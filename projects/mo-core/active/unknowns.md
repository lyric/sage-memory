# Unknowns: GTD Skills

Gaps and questions that need resolving before planning.

---

## Scope Unknowns

- [ ] Which GTD stages are in scope? (capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage — all or subset?)
- [ ] What documents/workflows does the user currently manage in Obsidian?
- [ ] What's the Obsidian vault structure? (PARA, GTD folders, custom?)
- [ ] Should mind-sweep move to gtd-mo-core or stay bundled?

## Technical Unknowns

- [ ] What does "usable without mo-core" mean concretely? (Claude Code skill? standalone CLI? plain markdown docs?)
- [ ] Skill pack (pure SKILL.md) vs hybrid plugin (skills + TypeScript runtime)?
- [ ] How to interact with Obsidian vault? (direct file read/write? obsidian-cli? local REST API?)
- [ ] Repo structure for gtd-mo-core — standalone skills repo that mo-core pulls in?

## Integration Unknowns

- [ ] How will mo-core bundle these? (git submodule? npm package? config extraDirs?)
- [ ] User mentioned "reference info" to include — what is it?
